      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer player that I love because he has a very strong growth mindset. Although he has taken a lot of tournaments throughout his career, he is never satisfied and he will always fight for more. Also, he is very self-disciplined that he will strictly control his diet and training frequency to make sure that he can perform his highest quality in each match.</p>
